# Student_Outcomes
**By Gwen Rino**

This is my capstone project for the Springboard Introduction to Data Science course, which I completed in October 2017. 

In this project, I analyzed a [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) of information about just over 1,000 high school students in Portugal, collected in 2008. I used four different statistical models (linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) to try to predict which of these students are at risk of academic failure.

You can find my final report, code, and evaluation in the Final Project folder. You can also find a video of my presentation of my final project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N07EHoc8kWg&index=1&list=PLjKxfZpleE6B-e6hDQ4m7Yrs7s9HIoZZs).
